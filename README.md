# RPPYG Maker

An alternative to RPG Maker, using Pygame.

### Known Issues

- Python and pip must be installed for the engine to function correctly, even after converting the main script into an executable file. (However, games built and exported with this engine don’t require any additional installations.)
- When running on certain Linux versions that use the i3 window manager, clicking on a menu that launches another GUI program (such as ‘New Project’ or ‘Open Project’) results in no response except for keyboard inputs. A workaround for this issue is to move the GUI program to a different workspace.
